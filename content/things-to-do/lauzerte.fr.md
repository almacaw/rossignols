Head to this medieval bastide and reminiscent of a Tuscan Landscape for great views, a stunning old stone town and a fine square.

Lauzerte has been classified since April 1990 among the villages labeled The Most Beautiful Villages in Franceâ€”villages selected for the quality of their heritage, their architecture and their environment.

Built on the trade on the pilgrims route to Compostela, pilgrims still pass though the two and a visit can be accompanied with a walk along the historic Pilgrims route.
